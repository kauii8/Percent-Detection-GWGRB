# Percent-Detection-GWGRB
Python code for detecting percent detection of GWs and GRBs

The first actual Git repository I have made. Prior to uploading this code to Git I was using my own version control and that is why there are very few commits. 

After reading the code you may realize it is a bit haphazard and not commented. I understand this is bad code practice and I'm sorry in advance. Anyway the result should be correct nonetheless. I will probably not be updating this much.
